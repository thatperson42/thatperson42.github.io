      <h2>Books enjoyed</h2>
        Here are some books I've enjoyed recently:

        <h3>2024</h3>
          <p>Skunk Works, Ben Rich and Leo Janos. A sad tale of how bureaucracy grows. But it shows another way is possible. How can we return to this golden age?</p>
          <p>The Godfather, Mario Puzo. A fun Mafia novel that's really best as a companion to the film. A description of motivation that might take a page in the novel may be conveyed by a single gesture in the film, and reading the novel appreciates the subtleties of the book.</p>
          <p>Poor Charlie's Almanack, Charlie Munger. Some overlap across stories, but a unique perspective from someone curious about life.</p>
          <p>The Anxious Generation, Jonathan Haidt. Terrifying possibility of what might be happening from smartphones. In some ways an extension of Bowling Alone from 2000: social isolation accelerating.</p>
        <h3>2023</h3>
          <p>River of Shadows: Eadweard Muybridge and the Technological Wild West, Rebecca Solnit. I wish more history books were written in this style: technological change understood as the main driver of progress, but with impacts on culture discussed.</p>
          <p>Thinking in Systems, Donella H Meadows. Intuitive descriptions of how systems can interact. Easy to understand but not a natural way of thinking. This book is not a statistics book, but these same challenges are why people struggle learning statistics.</p>
          <p>Elon Musk, Walter Isaacson. An anti-management book: if one were to take standard management articles seriously, Elon's approach would be incredibly broken. But it works, so something needs to be updated. My big takeaway was "try a lot of stuff as fast as possible, some stuff will work, others won't and you change that." For elites worried about "messing up" or people trained by grades to not make mistakes this is unintuitive.</p>
          <p>The Wandering Earth, Cixin Liu. With the exception of The Three-Body Problem (the first novel in that trilogy), Cixin Liu's scenarios are more amenable to short-story format.</p>
          <p>The Domestic Revolution: How the Introduction of Coal into Victorian Homes Changed Everything, Ruth Goodman. Fascinating to hear the history of coal leading up to the Industrial Revolution. How to Be a Victorian is my favorite Ruth Goodman book, however.</p>
